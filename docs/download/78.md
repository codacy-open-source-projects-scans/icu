# ICU 78

ICU is the [premier library for software internationalization](https://icu.unicode.org/#h.i33fakvpjb7o),
used by a [wide array of companies and organizations](https://icu.unicode.org/#h.f9qwubthqabj).

## Release Overview

* Download: [releases/tag/release-78.1](https://github.com/unicode-org/icu/releases/tag/release-78.1)
* Maven: [com.ibm.icu / icu4j / version 78.1](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.ibm.icu/icu4j/78.1)

ICU 78 updates to
[Unicode 17](https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode17.0.0/)
([blog](https://blog.unicode.org/2025/09/unicode-170-release-announcement.html)),
including new characters and scripts, emoji, collation & IDNA changes, and corresponding APIs and implementations.

It also updates to
[CLDR 48](https://cldr.unicode.org/downloads/cldr-48)
([beta blog](https://blog.unicode.org/2025/10/unicode-cldr-48-beta-available-for.html))
locale data with new locales, and various additions and corrections.

In Java, there is a new Segmenter API which is easier and safer to use than BreakIterator.\
In C++, there is a new set of APIs for Unicode string (UTF-8/16/32) code point iteration
that works seamlessly with modern C++ iterators and ranges.

The Java implementation of the
[CLDR MessageFormat 2.0 specification](https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr35/tr35-messageFormat.html)
has been updated to CLDR 48.
The core API has been upgraded to “draft”, while the Data Model API remains in technology preview.

The C++ implementation of MessageFormat 2.0 is at CLDR 47 level and remains in technology preview.

ICU 78 and CLDR 48 are major releases, including a new version of Unicode and major locale data improvements.

For more details, including migration issues, see below.

Please use the [icu-support mailing list](https://icu.unicode.org/contacts) and/or
[find/submit error reports](https://icu.unicode.org/bugs).

### Attention: Future Changes

Beginning with CLDR 49 / ICU 79 (2026-mar), CLDR and ICU are planning to make changes in
time formatting options for the hour cycle (details of 12/24 hour formats),
make the week-of-year numbering always follow ISO rules,
and remove the pre-Meiji Japanese eras.

See the [CLDR V49 advance warnings](https://cldr.unicode.org/downloads/cldr-48#v49-advance-warnings).

## Common Changes

* [Unicode 17](https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode17.0.0/)
  ([blog](https://blog.unicode.org/2025/09/unicode-170-release-announcement.html)):
  * Adds two modern-use scripts: Beria Erfe & Tolong Siki
  * Adds two historic scripts & more than 4300 new CJK ideographs
  * New currency sign: SAUDI RIYAL SIGN
  * Eight new emoji characters
  * Segmentation improvements (word & line breaking)
  * Identifiers & security:
    The majority of CJK ideographs, the Bopomofo script,
    and more than 1100 other pre-Unicode 17 characters,
    are no longer recommended for use in identifiers by default
    (Identifier_Status & Identifier_Type properties),
    after thorough review.
    * For CJK ideographs, only 19,842 that are in modern common use (out of now more than 100,000)
      remain recommended for default identifier use.
* [CLDR 48](https://cldr.unicode.org/downloads/cldr-48)
  ([beta blog](https://blog.unicode.org/2025/10/unicode-cldr-48-beta-available-for.html)):
  * Significant data updates across all locales
  * Locales which are now at modern coverage level: Akan, Bashkir, Chuvash, Kazakh (Arabic), Romansh, Shan, Quechua
  * Locales which are now at moderate coverage level: Anii, Esperanto
  * Many new measurement units, for scientific contexts (coulombs, farads, teslas, etc.)
    and for English systems (fortnights, imperial pints, etc.)
  * Some measurement unit identifiers changed, see [CLDR 48 Migration](https://cldr.unicode.org/downloads/cldr-48#migration)
* Time zone data (tzdata) version 2025b (2025-mar).

## ICU4C Specific Changes

* [API changes since ICU4C 77 (Markdown)](https://github.com/unicode-org/icu/blob/maint/maint-78/icu4c/APIChangeReport.md) /
  [(HTML)](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/unicode-org/icu/blob/maint/maint-78/icu4c/APIChangeReport.html)
  * The widely used class Locale has been optimized. Locale objects for most common locale IDs now only use 40 bytes
    (down from at least 224 bytes).
    ([ICU-20392](https://unicode-org.atlassian.net/browse/ICU-20392))
  * New set of “C++ Header-Only APIs” for Unicode string (UTF-8/16/32) code point iteration
    that works seamlessly with modern C++ iterators and ranges.
    As with the existing C macros, there are versions which validate the code unit sequences on the fly,
    as well as fast but “unsafe” versions which assume & require well-formed strings.
    ([ICU-23004](https://unicode-org.atlassian.net/browse/ICU-23004)]):\
    [unicode/utfiterator.h](https://unicode-org.github.io/icu-docs/apidoc/dev/icu4c/utfiterator_8h.html)\
    (For an introduction to “C++ Header-Only APIs” see
    this section of the [ICU 76 Migration Issues](76.md#migration-issues).)
  * Additional Unicode helper APIs
    ([ICU-23152](https://unicode-org.atlassian.net/browse/ICU-23152)):
    * ([unicode/utf.h](https://unicode-org.github.io/icu-docs/apidoc/dev/icu4c/utf_8h.html),
      [unicode/utf8.h](https://unicode-org.github.io/icu-docs/apidoc/dev/icu4c/utf8_8h.html)):
      U_IS_CODE_POINT(cp), U_IS_SCALAR_VALUE(cp), U8_LENGTH_FROM_LEAD_BYTE\[_UNSAFE\]
    * ([icu::UnicodeString](https://unicode-org.github.io/icu-docs/apidoc/dev/icu4c/classicu_1_1UnicodeString.html)):
      begin(), end(), rbegin(), rend(), push_back(c)
      (a UnicodeString is now a C++ “range” of char16_t code units),
      toUTF8String() without output string *parameter*
    * (new [unicode/utfiterator.h](https://unicode-org.github.io/icu-docs/apidoc/dev/icu4c/utfiterator_8h.html)):
      “Range” classes AllCodePoints & AllScalarValues
    * (new [unicode/utfstring.h](https://unicode-org.github.io/icu-docs/apidoc/dev/icu4c/utfstring_8h.html)):
      Functions that write a code point to a string object

## ICU4J Specific Changes

* The minimum required Java version has been upgraded from Java 8 to Java 11.
  ([ICU-23072](https://unicode-org.atlassian.net/browse/ICU-23072))\
  This is a significant, useful update in terms of the Java language and
  standard library, and simplifies ICU tooling.
  Note that [Android desugaring](https://developer.android.com/studio/write/java11-default-support-table)
  supports at least Java 11 since late 2023.
* [API Changes since ICU4J 77](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/unicode-org/icu/blob/maint/maint-78/icu4j/APIChangeReport.html)
  * New Segmenter API which is easier and safer to use than BreakIterator.
    The new API builds immutable objects and returns Java Streams of boundaries and segments.
    ([ICU-22789](https://unicode-org.atlassian.net/browse/ICU-22789))\
    See [package com.ibm.icu.segmenter](https://unicode-org.github.io/icu-docs/apidoc/dev/icu4j/com/ibm/icu/segmenter/package-summary.html),
    [interface Segmenter](https://unicode-org.github.io/icu-docs/apidoc/dev/icu4j/com/ibm/icu/segmenter/Segmenter.html)
    and its implementing classes, etc.
  * All clone() functions now explicitly return their class types, rather than Object (“covariant return types”),
    so that call sites no longer need to downcast.
    ([ICU-23140](https://unicode-org.atlassian.net/browse/ICU-23140))
  * Additional Unicode helper functions
    ([class UCharacter](https://unicode-org.github.io/icu-docs/apidoc/dev/icu4j/com/ibm/icu/lang/UCharacter.html)):
    isNoncharacter(cp), isScalarValue(cp), allCodePoints(), allScalarValuesStream(), etc.
    ([ICU-23152](https://unicode-org.atlassian.net/browse/ICU-23152))
    <!-- TODO: after release, change API docs links from dev to released -->
* We have removed the
   [ICU4J Locale Service Provider](../userguide/icu4j/locale-service-provider.md).
   ([ICU-23071](https://unicode-org.atlassian.net/browse/ICU-23071))\
   It had become much less useful than when we added it and had very low usage.
   Projects that used it should call ICU4J directly instead.
* The Java implementation of the
  [CLDR MessageFormat 2.0 specification](https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr35/tr35-messageFormat.html)
  has been updated to CLDR 48.
  The core API has been upgraded to “draft”, while the Data Model API remains in technology preview.

## Known Issues

* (none yet)

## Migration Issues

* (none yet)

### Migration Issues Related to CLDR
* See [CLDR 48 migration issues](https://cldr.unicode.org/downloads/cldr-48#migration)

## ICU4C Platform Support

ICU4C requires C++17 and has been tested with up to C++23.

We routinely test on recent versions of Linux, macOS, and Windows.

We accept patches for other platforms.

Windows: The minimum supported version is Windows 7.
(See [How To Build And Install On Windows](../userguide/icu4c/build.html#how-to-build-and-install-on-windows)
for more details.)

## ICU4J Platform Support

ICU4J works on Java 11..25 (at least).

ICU4J should work on Android API level 21 and later but may require “[library desugaring](https://developer.android.com/studio/write/java8-support#library-desugaring)”.
